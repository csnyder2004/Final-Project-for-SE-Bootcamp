# Final-Project-for-SE-Bootcamp
My name is Cole Snyder, and this is my final project for the Software Engineering Bootcamp.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, ENV, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, React, and Mongosh, along with the use of an external API.

The project includes a database schema with example data, an application layer written with Node.js and Express.js that creates a JSON API, and a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with the backend by sending and receiving JSON data.

It features a login and registration system that securely stores user credentials and generates an authentication token upon successful login.
I tested the token generation and login process using Postman to make sure everything works correctly and securely.
