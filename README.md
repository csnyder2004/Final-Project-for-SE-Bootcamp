# Final-Project-for-SE-Bootcamp
My name is Cole Snyder
This is my final Project for my Software Engineering Bootcamp. 
This Project includes HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, ENV, Mongodb, Node.js, Expree, React, Mongosh, and use of an api
This project is a database schema with some example data. There is an application layer written using node.js and express.js created by a JSON API. This single page application communicates with the application layer by sending and recieving JSON data. It has a login and registration screen that will remember your registered email and password and create a token. I checked this token and this login in POSTMAN.
